# Project Description
This is a simple project that aims to foster learning about Spring Boot using a non-relational database, among other concepts. This project serves as a foundation for learning about the tools and refining knowledge.

# Necessary Tools
- Java
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Intellij

# Prerequisite
For this project I am using a MongoDB database that is executed when we use the command below to run `Docker Compose` within the project in order to start the container containing the database.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Run the project
For this project, I'm using IntelliJ to create and configure it, so I recommend using this tool to run the project on your own machine. If you don't want to download IntelliJ, I recommend using Maven to run the project.
